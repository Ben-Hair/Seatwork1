		<td>Beautiful and majestic, Alaskan malamutes have a flirtatious tail that curls over their back. Their medium-sized nose, bright almond-shaped brown eyes, and alert, cheery demeanor exude unlimited vitality. When they are moving around, their pointed ears stand straight up and even lean back; when they are resting, their ears will droop slightly to the sides of their broad head.</td>
